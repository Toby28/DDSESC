# Emotional Styles Hide in Deep Speaker Embeddings: Disentangle Deep Speaker Embeddings for Speaker Clustering
This repo is for our IEEEASRU2025 paper "Emotional Styles Hide in Deep Speaker Embeddings: Disentangle Deep Speaker Embeddings for Speaker Clustering".

## Dataset
Please download the ESD(Emotional Speech Database) dataset from [https://hltsingapore.github.io/ESD/](https://hltsingapore.github.io/ESD/) and IEMOCAP dataset from [https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/).

## Speaker Embeddings
This project supports three types of speaker embeddings: d-vector, r-vector, and ECAPA-TDNN. For r-vector and ECAPA-TDNN, you can download pretrained models from the [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) toolkit. For d-vector, please use the pretrained model provided in the official repository from [https://github.com/yistLin/dvector](https://github.com/yistLin/dvector).
